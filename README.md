# Web assets for pyLDAvis

These files are served up by a CDN, [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com), for the visualization. Each time one of the assets changes and a release is made the new version needs to be placed in this branch. The old files must never be removed from the dir either so older versions of the visualization will continue to work.
